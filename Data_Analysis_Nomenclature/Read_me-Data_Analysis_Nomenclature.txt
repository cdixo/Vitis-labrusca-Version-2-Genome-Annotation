Overall Folder Naming and Contents - 
This folder contains all of the genes named as per the initial, in silico,
data analysis nomenclature which was used for all data analysis in the 
manuscript.  This nomenclature was created by the gene annotation program
and was thus employed for all downstream analyses.  This nomenclature
SHOULD NOT be used by researchers moving forward and is only presented 
herein for use when reviewing the background data files found in the 
supplementary materials of the manuscript, of which, all use this nomenclature
system.  Ultimately, the 'Finalized Nomenclature' system should be used moving 
forward.  Regardless, the 'Data Analysis' nomenclature is the defined as 
per the following - 

ProgramName-ChromosomeNumber-ProgramName-"gene"-GeneNumber - Example with Fields Noted
maker-15-augustus-gene-170.54 - Example of Gene with Fields Filled 
(Note gene names should be italicized)


Files Found Within This Folder - 
This folder contains all of the following data in four different files.
They are all zipped for ease of download.
The four datasets are the following - 

CDS Sequences = ...cds-transcripts.zip
The Vitis labrusca acc. 'GREM4' Version 2 (updated) Gene Annotation = ...gff3.zip
