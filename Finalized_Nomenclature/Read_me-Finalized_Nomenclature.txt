Overall Folder Naming and Contents - 
This folder contains all of the genes named as per the finalized, public-facing
nomenclature which should be used by all researchers moving forward.  This
nomenclature was also employed for the main body of the manuscript but the 
underlying data was still in the 'Data Analysis' nomenclature which was created
by the gene annotation program and was thus employed for all downstream analyses.
Regardless, this nomenclature is the defined as per the following - 

Species_Accession_ChromosomeNumbergGeneNumber - Example with Fields Noted
Vitla_GREM4_11g130.11 - Example of Gene with Fields Filled 
(Note gene names should be italicized)


Files Found Within This Folder - 
This folder contains all of the following data in four different files.
They are all zipped for ease of download.
The four datasets are the following - 

CDS Sequences = ...cds-transcripts.zip
The Vitis labrusca acc. 'GREM4' Version 2 (updated) Gene Annotation = ...gff3.zip
mRNA Sequences = ...mrna-transcripts.zip
