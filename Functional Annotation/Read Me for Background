Functional annotation was conducted via multiple methods including...
1. 'Funannotate_annotate' which included querying of the databases PFAM, InterPro, EggNog, UniProtKB, MEROPS, CAZyme, and GO ontology
2. InterProScan
3. OmicsBOX
4. Manual Curration for genes of particular interest via BLAST


Ultimately, the files should all contain the same, or similar, information, but in some cases differences have been identified
which is why all of the datasets have been provided as in some instances a certain dataset may have informed an annotation while
for another gene another dataset informed the annotation.
