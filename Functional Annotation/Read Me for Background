The finalized functional annotations for genes in (most notably) 'GREM4' and 'PN40024' can be found in the excel spreadsheet file
of 'Gene Functional Annotations V6'.  Please see the title page of this file for additional information.  This file was informed by
4 different methods of functional annotation, all being used to generate the finalized functional annotation file itelf.

The functional annotation was conducted via 4 different major methods, including...
1. 'Funannotate_annotate' which included querying of the databases PFAM, InterPro, EggNog, UniProtKB, MEROPS, CAZyme, and GO ontology
2. InterProScan
3. OmicsBOX
4. Manual Curration for genes via BLAST

Not all genes were assigned functional annotations as their sequences varied too greatly from that of any known annotated genes
or proteins and thus were left unannotated to avoid potentially overzealously presumptive annotations in the annotation.  Please note, 
functionally annotated genes herein are only hypothetical in nature as they were named strictly via sequence homology and have not 
been functionally validated.

In practice, the annotation files generated by all of the methods should have been highly similar or identical.  However, this
was not the case in reality as each method was informed by different databases and had different constraints.  We elected to inform
our functional annotation by these various methods in order to achieve the most accurate and informative annotation possible, despite
conflicts between programs sometimes arrising in naming.  In these instances, all differing annotation for the gene in question were 
retained in the 'Gene_Functional_Annotations' file.  Nonetheless, we have also provided herein the originally generated annotation
outputs for each of the methods should you wish to review them independently.
