# Vitis-labrusca-Version-2-Genome-Annotation
The 2nd version of the Vitis labrusca genome annotation as released in 2024 from the Gschwend Grapevine Genetics Laboratory at The Ohio State University.  The accession employed for the creation of this gene annotation was Vitis labrusca acc. 'GREM4', the same accession used by the Gschwend Lab by Li and Gschwend for the original annotation.

'Public-Facing' is the public gene names (Vitla_GREM4_#g#.## format).

'In-silico' is the gene names in the format I used in all of my analyses prior to paper submission which perhaps a reviewer could find useful depending on the question (annotation_program_name_#_another_program_#.## format).
