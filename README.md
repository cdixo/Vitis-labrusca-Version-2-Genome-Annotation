# Vitis-labrusca-Version-2-Genome-Annotation
The 2nd version of the Vitis labrusca genome annotation as released in 2024 from the Gschwend Grapevine Genetics Laboratory at The Ohio State University as first referenced in the manuscript 'Trichomes and Unique Gene Expression Confer Insect Herbivory Resistance in Vitis labrusca Grapevines' by Dixon & Gschwend.  The accession employed for the creation of this gene annotation was Vitis labrusca acc. 'GREM4', the same accession used by the Gschwend Lab by Li & Gschwend 2023 (Vitis labrusca genome assembly reveals diversification between wild and cultivated grapevine genomes) for the original annotation.

'Public-Facing' is the public gene names (Vitla_GREM4_#g#.## format).

'In-silico' is the gene names in the format I used in all of my analyses prior to paper submission which perhaps an individual reading one of the manuscripts associated with this gene annotation (from Dixon & Gschwend) could find useful, especially when reviewing the supplementary information (annotation_program_name_#_another_program_#.## format).
